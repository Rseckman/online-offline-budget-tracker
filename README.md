## Description


`PROJECT DESCRIPTION:` the online-offline-budget-tracker is an application that has the ability to track your spending whether you are connected to the internet or not.  It uses Cache and indexedDB to store information and data, while still having a responsive application, and then sending in bulk the updated data once connected back to the internet.  The user can add or subtract spending for the amount and what the spending was from, and then have it displayed on the page in a graph to show the spending patterns.


`WHO IS IT FOR?:` this app is for someone who wants to keep track of a budget in a simple form and see the results simply laid out before them.  It is also for someone who wants to be able to adjust and interact with the app whether or not they are connected to the internet.
